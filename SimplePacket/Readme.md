## SimplePacket
This library provides an easy and simple protocol for two Arduino's communicating through software serial. The user simply defines a data structure to group together all the data they want to send. The library takes care of crafting a packet out of the data and provides some protection against transmit errors through checksums.

### Install
To install, place the SimplePacket directory under your Arduino libraries folder. This is usually under ~\Documents\Arduino\libraries. Then restart the IDE.

### Usage
Please see the Examples to find out how to use the library.
